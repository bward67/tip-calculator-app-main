I loved this challenge - it was the perfect balance b/w html, css and js. I think it is all as it should be - however - I completed it after a few drinks and a late lunch at the Waterfront in Cape Town so maybe I will wake up tomorrow and realise I missed something? But you must stay happy and confident or why bother! I might even put this app onto my phone for those nights out with "questionable" friends who practice "creative calulations" when it comes time to split the bill!
